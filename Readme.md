# Introduction

ImageProcessor is a simple image processor that generates frammed images from a given source directory.

# Using

To use the application, just give the source and target directories.

If you wish to protect your images with a copyright message, you can also give one.

Finally set how much to keep from the original size from the source images.

The generated images will be framed with the copyright message on the lower right corner.

# Building

This application was developed in Java. A Netbeans project definition file is also available.
